Bugs in Teammate Code

I used Chris Brackett's (bracketc) code for my testing.

Bug in Smithy:
After running my random test for the Smithy function I get the following results:

Test list: 
 Test 1: Hand should only have 2 more cards.  
 Test 2: Deck should be decreased by 3 cards.  
 Test 3: Played card count should be increased by 1.  
 Test 4: Smithy should be on the top of played cards pile 
 Test 5: The other player's hand count should be the same.  
 Test 6: The other player's decks should be the same.
Number of tests: 1000 
SMITHY TEST #1: 1000 FAILURES
SMITHY TEST #2: 1000 FAILURES
SMITHY TEST #3: 0 FAILURES
SMITHY TEST #4: 0 FAILURES
SMITHY TEST #5: 0 FAILURES
SMITHY TEST #6: 0 FAILURES

This means that there is some problem with the draw part of Smithy, likely that too many or too few cards are being drawn.  I take a look at the code and son line 1248 of dominion.c the play smithy function has the following for loop:

for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
  {
    drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
  }

Thus, the smith function is drawing 4 cards (0-3 loop), instead of the 3 it is supposed to draw.

After fixing the loop to be:  for (i = 0; i < 3; i++), the tests passed properly.

Bug in Village:

After running my random test for the Village function I get the following results:
Test list: 
 Test 1: Hand should be the same size  
 Test 2: Played card count should be increased by 1. 
 Test 3: Number of actions should be increased by 2 
 Test 4: Deck should be decreased by 1 card 
 Test 5: Village should be the top card on the discard 
 Test 6: The other player's hand count should be the same.  
 Test 7: The other player's decks should be the same.
Number of tests: 1000 
VILLAGE TEST #1: 0 FAILURES
VILLAGE TEST #2: 1000 FAILURES
VILLAGE TEST #3: 0 FAILURES
VILLAGE TEST #4: 0 FAILURES
VILLAGE TEST #5: 1000 FAILURES
VILLAGE TEST #6: 0 FAILURES
VILLAGE TEST #7: 0 FAILURES

This means there is some issue with the discard portion of the village code.  Again, I first inspect the code, and I see that on line 1299 there is the following code: discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 1);

For discardCard, if the last parameter passed is greater than 0 then the card will be trashed instead of discarded.  When that happens the card will not be added to the played pile, meaning it will not increase the played card count, and the card will not be put on the discard pile, meaning that Village would not be on the top of that pile.  Thus the card is trashed.
