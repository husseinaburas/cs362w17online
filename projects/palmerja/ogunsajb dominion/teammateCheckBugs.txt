Teammate identified Bug smithy:
***********
Error in playsmithy() where smithy call draws zero cards at a time. This is indicative of line 831 where there is only a playsmithy
call and not a forloop to start a drawing card process. This bug continues in case smithy because there isn't a discardCard call either.
I found this bug when attempting to insert a draw command directly into my testing files which showed that no cards have been discarded either.

Teammate identified Bug greathall: 
***********
Error in great_hall() where great hall card doesn't draw a card, doesn't add an action nor removes the card from hand. This is shown on line
859 that the case great_hall is blank, only a call to playGreat_hall. In short, like playsmithy() call, the lines were deleated rather than tampered with.
When calling the great_hall command, noticed that I wasn't adding a card to my hand. With forcing a card to my hand, I wasn't allowed to play another action. 
This second finding forced the idea of my unittest to force both +1 card and +1 action lead to great_hall never being discarded from the hand. At somepoints this created
an infinate loop because the players hand could never reach 0 and "pass the turn" because great_hall was never discarded.

** Card Test 2: Great Hall **
Expected value: 1, Result: 0
Expected card count: 4, Result: 5
** End Card Test 2: Great Hall **


additional bug changes:
***********
In the initialize game function it did not draw 5 cards into the players hand like the game should, so I manually fixed that mechanic.
 In the fullDeckCount function it was not counting the full deck, it was only counted if there was a certain card in the deck (i.e the card I was testing), 
 so I fixed that by just having a count variable and adding deckCount, discardCount, and handCount to my files.
