Title: Wrong card removed when discarding smithy card   

Class:Serious bug
e.g. "Feature Request", "System Error", "Serious Bug"

URL:        n/a

Is it reproducible: Yes / Occasionally / One Time / No

Description
===========
after playing the smithy card the wrong card is removed from the current players hand and is added to the played card pile. The smithy card is still in the current players hand


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
call the cardEffect method with the "smithy" card or "12" as the card parameter and an instantiated gamestate


Expected Results
----------------
after playing the card the hand count should be decremented by 1. Since the smithy card adds three cards to the hand the net change is an increase of 2 to the current  player's hand count. Also the smithy card should be removed from the players hand and moved to the played card pile. The played card count should increase by one.


Actual Results
--------------
The current players hand count is increasing properly, it is increasing by 2. The played card pile count is also incrementing by 1 as it should. The smithy card is not being removed from the players hand, and when checking the top card of the played card pile it is not the smithy card.
