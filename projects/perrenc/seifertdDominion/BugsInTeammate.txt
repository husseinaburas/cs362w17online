########## Bug #01 ##########
#############################
Title: playSmithy Incorrect Card Pickup Count

Affected Files: dominion.c

Pertinent Code:
dominion.c: Line 717 

Test Environment: Red Hat Linux 4.8.5-4 (Kernel 3.10.0)

Expected Result:
A call to playSmithy should add three cards to the player's hand, then 
discard the played card. The final result should be a hand with two extra cards
in it.

Actual Result:
playSmithy picks up five cards instead of three, then discards a card like
normal. The result is a hand with four extra cards instead of two.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the other game functions to set up a normal game state.
2. Set a current player.
3. Save the handcount for the player in a temp variable.
4. Call playSmithy against the selected player.
5. Compare the saved handcount to the new handcount to see incorrect number.

########## Bug #02 ##########

Title: playAdventurer Incorrect Hand Count When Drawing Non-Treasure Cards

Affected Files: dominion.c

Pertinent Code:
dominion.c: Line 701 

Test Environment: Red Hat Linux 4.8.5-4 (Kernel 3.10.0)

Expected Result:
In a call to playAdventurer, during the process of "picking up" cards, 
the temp hand stores a copy of any cards that aren't treasure cards, then
removes the just saved "top card". This allows cards to be shuffled back into
the game without being lost.

Actual Result:
In a call to playAdventurer, during the process of "picking up" cards,
instead of removing the top card, an invalid top card is instead added. 
Depending on the previous state of the hand, the error may not show itself, 
for example, if every card picked up were a treasure card. In the case where
this bug is hit, invalid cards could be shuffled back into the players hand at 
a later time, causing major bugs in gameplay.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the other game functions to set up a normal game state.
2. Set a current player.
4. Call playAdventurer against the selected player.
5. Manually inspect the hand of the player and note invalid card indexes.
