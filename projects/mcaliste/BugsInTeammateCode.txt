Bugs In Teammate's Code

My teammate introduced the same bug into Smithy as I did:  changing the loop condition
to draw four cards instead of three:  for (i = 0; i <= 3; i++)

Similarly, my teammate also changed Council Room to make the player draw five cards
instead of four.  However, they again changed the loop:  for (i = 0; i <= 4; i++)

My unit test for Adventurer did not catch the bug my teammate introduced that caused
the player to draw three treasure cards instead of two, as it only checked that the
player had two additional treasure cards.  My random test had additional checks for
an increase of one and two treasure cards in the playerâ€™s hand by comparing their hand
count before and after playing Adventurer.  
The random test found the bug in the loop: while (drawntreasure <= 2)
