/*
	cardtest2.c: Testing the Adventurer card.
	
	Description: Will test the implemetation of the playAdventurer function. The Adventurer card, 
	when played, causes the player to reveal cards from their deck until 2 treasure cards have been 
	revealed. Those 2 treasure cards are then added into the players hand. The code for this is 
	relatively simple, a while loop is initiated that will terminate when the drawntreasure variable, 
	initiated as 0, reaches 2. Each iteration of the while loop checks if the current players deck is empty, 
	if it is, the deck is reshuffled, a card is drawn and checked for treasure status. If the card drawn is 
	a treasure, the drawntreasure variable is incremented. Otherwise, the drawn card is put into a temphand 
	array to be discarded later. Once this while loop terminates (2 treasure cards drawn), the temporary 
	hand array is emptied/discarded and 0 is returned to exit the switch statement.
