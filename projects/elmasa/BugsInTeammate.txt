From the gcov coverage results of the randomtestcard1, we can see that the discardCard function was called twice as many times as the number of times playSmithy is tested. Numerous state change assertions failed for playSmithy, such as handCount, also directing our attention to this bug as a symptom. Based on this symptom, we can find that the cause is because discardCard is called double the amount of times than it should. A quick visual scan of the code helps to clearly see the location of the bug on line 1281, where discardCard has been called second time.Bug 2- playAdventurer: An interesting bug that is rather subtle and may normally be difficult to realize was found in the first assertion test of the playAdventurer function call for both unittest and randomtestadventurer. The symptom is that the function does not return a successful completion code. While the cause of such a bug can be varied in different circumstances, the cause in this case was clear with a simple visual scan of the code. The first and most obvious thing to check was to make sure an int of 0 was being returned in the function. However before needing to proceed further with more in depth analysis, the cause has been discovered as the return statement was never called prior to the closing brace of the function. Omitting a return statement in C which expects a return value can yield undefined problems.
