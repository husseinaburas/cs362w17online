Bug Name: isGameOver isn't returning true under the correct circumstances.
Bug ID: 1
Area Path: make myTest > dominion.c > isGameOver()
Build Number: N/A
Severity: TBD
Priority: TBD
Assigned to: TBD
Reported By: Micheal Willard
Reported On: 3/3/2017
Reason: A state of game over is occurring when it shouldn't
Status: Open
Environment: bash

Description:
  When executing the unit test suite, we see that 2 conditions where a value of
  false should be returned from the isGameOver() function, it is returning a
  true value.  The instance happens when there is 0 copper or 0 silver, but
  gold and province still have values greater than 0.  The true state should
  only be returned if all 4 are at a value of 0.

Steps To Reproduce:
  1) Navigate to the creamersDominion folder in the unix bash terminal
  2) Run : $ make myTest
  3) Open unittestresult.out
  4) Examine results of isGameOver()

Expected result:
  The test results in the unittestresults.out file should show "PASS" for all 4
  tests of the function.

Bug Name: Smithy not handling cards correctly.
Bug ID: 2
Area Path: make myTest > dominion.c > isGameOver()
Build Number: N/A
Severity: TBD
Priority: TBD
Assigned to: TBD
Reported By: Micheal Willard
Reported On: 3/3/2017
Reason: The smithy card fails 3 out of 4 of it's tests.
Status: Open
Environment: bash

Description:
  The smithy card should add 3 cards to the hand, remove 3 cards from the deck
  and indicate a discarded card in the discard count.  These all fail.  Debug
  print statements indicate that the hand and deck count prior to the function
  call are identical to after the function call.
  Note: Line 1316 appears to be setting the current player to the next player.

Steps To Reproduce:
  1) Navigate to the creamersDominion folder in the unix bash terminal
  2) Run : $ make myTest
  3) Open unittestresult.out
  4) Examine results of smithy

Expected result:
  The hand and deck count values should be altered by 3.  The discard count
  should be at least 1.
