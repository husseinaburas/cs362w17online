For inputChar, I started by obtaining a random number that goes with a character from the ASCII table.
Selecting a random character for each iteration gets to state 9 very quickly.

For inputString, I tried generating characters the same way as the previous function and then returing them as a string.
This tester found the error after many many iterations which took quite some time.
