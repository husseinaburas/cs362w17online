Bug ID: refacAdventurer() bug 1

What version it was detected on: lamaa's Assignment 4 code

Summary of bug: Three treasures are drawn by refacAdventurer() instead of two.

How to make it happen: Calling refacAdventurer() normally during gameplay will
always trigger this bug.

Estimated severity and priority: This is a severe error in the gameplay logic,
meaning that the game cannot be played correctly. It is a high priority to fix
this bug.

Details: The Adventurer card is supposed to draw two treasure cards from the
player's deck, shuffling as necessary. This function instead draws three
treasure cards. In every case tried during testing, the function either ends
with one or two too many cards in the player's hand. Tracing the value of
the variables shows that when more than two treasure cards are available in the
desk, one of these extra cards is always a treasure card.

Fix: On line 649 of dominion.c, the while loop should be controlled by
(drawntreasure < 2) instead of (drawntreasure <= 2).

Bug ID: refacAdventurer() bug 2

What version it was detected on: lamaa's Assignment 4 code

Summary of bug: The Adventurer card is not discarded by refacAdventurer().

How to make it happen: Calling refacAdventurer() normally during gameplay will
always trigger this bug.

Estimated severity and priority: This is a severe error in the gameplay logic,
meaning that the game cannot be played correctly. It is a high priority to fix
this bug.

Details: The Adventurer card is supposed to be discarded after its effect has
been played. In every case tried during testing, the function either ends
with one or two too many cards in the player's hand. Tracing the value of
the variables shows that one of these extra cards is always the Adventurer card
itself.

Fix: Before the return statement on line 667 of dominion.c, the function should
make a call to the discardCard() helper function to discard the Adventurer.

Bug ID: refacSmithy() bug 1

What version it was detected on: lamaa's Assignment 4 code

Summary of bug: Four cards are drawn by refacSmithy() instead of three.

How to make it happen: Calling refacSmithy() normally during gameplay will
always trigger this bug.

Estimated severity and priority: This is a severe error in the gameplay logic,
meaning that the game cannot be played correctly. It is a high priority to fix
this bug.

Details: The Smithy card is supposed to draw three cards from the player's deck
and add them to their hand. This function instead draws four cards and adds them
to the player's hand. In every case tried during testing, the function both adds
one too many cards to the player's hand and removes one too many cards from the
player's deck.

Fix: On line 674 of dominion.c, the for loop should be controlled by
(i < 3) instead of (i <= 3).
