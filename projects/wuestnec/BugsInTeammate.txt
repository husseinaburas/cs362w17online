Title: Discovered bugs in yaffee's version of dominion.c

Problem: Players only drawing two cards when playing Smithy (smithyCard() function)
Function: smithyCard()
Problem: When a player plays the Smithy card, (s)he should draw three cards from his or her deck. However,
		my unit and random tests for smithyCard() discovered that after the function finished executing, the 
		current player's hand contained one fewer card than expected and his or her deck contained one more card
		than expected. I discovered that this issue was due to a bug on line 1203, where a for loop is set up.
		This loop, within which the current player draws a card from the deck and adds it to the hand, will loop
		only two times instead of the three times that are required.
Solution: Changing the loop on line 1203 so that the code within executes three times instead of two would
		fix this issue (example: (i = 0; i < 3; i++)).
		
Problem: Adventurer card not being discarded after being played
Function: adventurerCard()
Problem: My unit and random tests found that, after playing an Adventurer card, the current player was
		ending up with one-too-many cards in his or her hand than expected. Additionally, the played
		cards pile contained one-too-few cards, and the last-played card was not an Adventurer (as would
		be expected). I found that the source of this bug was the lack of a discardCard() call (or other
		bit of code for the current player to discard the played Adventurer card) following the execution
		of the rest of the function. The card should be discarded at approximately line 1195.
Solution: Add a discardCard() method call or similar code to move the Adventurer card from the current
		player's deck to the played cards pile.
