Bugs from unit testing
-	The kingdomCards() function allowed non-kingdom cards to be assigned, multiple of the same type of card to be assigned,
negative values to be assigned and out of range values to be assigned.
-	Calling useSmithy() resulted in handCount not being incremented by two, smithy wasn’t placed in played cards, and deckCount was
 not decremented by 3
-	Calling useAdventurer() resulted in playedCardCount not being incremented appropriately, and adventurer not being placed in played cards
-	Calling useGreatHall() resulted in numActions to not be at appropriate level
