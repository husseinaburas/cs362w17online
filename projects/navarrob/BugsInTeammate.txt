Bugs in Teammate Code

Card: Smithy
Bug: Hand and deck count do not increment correctly
Discussion: The smithy card is overdrawing cards due to a bug in line 1298. The way the for loop is configured allows
a player to draw 4 cards instead of 3. The bug appears every time so it can reproduced by simply playing the simthy card.

Card: Smithy
Bug: Played cards incorrect after playing card.
Discussion: After the Smithy card is played, the playedCardCount is incorrect. This is due to a bug on line 1303. The way
that the discardCard call is being made is asking for the card to be trashed. This issue appears every time so it can be
reproduced by simply playing the smithy card. This is not the desired effect after Playing the card and the issue can be
fixed by changing the trashed flag from 0 to 1.

Card: Adventurer
Bug: Hand count incorrect
Discussion: After playing the Adventurer card, the deckCount is incorrect. This is due to a missing discardCard call after the
Adventurer card is played. The issue appears every time so it can be reproduced by simply playing the adventurer card and checking the 
hand count before and after the card is played. To correct this error we could add a discardCard call at the end of the function.
