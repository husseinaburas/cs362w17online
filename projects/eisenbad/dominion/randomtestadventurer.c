   Description: Tests the implementation of the dominion adventurer action card. Adventurer costs six coin to buy, 
   and when used the player will reveal cards from their deck until two treasure cards are revealed, which will
   be placed into the players hand. The remaining revealed cards are discarded.

   Pass Conditions:
     1. No extra coins are awarded to current player
     2. No extra actions are gained
     3. Current player receives up to two treasures from their deck
     4. Player's hand count increases by number of extra treasures drawn from deck
     5. No state change occurs to victory or kingdom card piles
     6. No state change occurs for other players
     7. Cards revealed while searching for treasures are in the discard pile
