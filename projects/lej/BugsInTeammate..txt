Bugs founded in Teammate: Gabriel Guzman

For adventurer card function-
In randomtestadventurer.c, sometimes there would be at least 1-3 errors,
sometimes there would be no errors, and sometimes there would be a error
that would lead to a segmentation fault out of 150 different runs. 

Assertion passed: Adventurer Card Effect
Assertion failed: handCount
Assertion failed: Treasures

Number of times adventurer function run successfuly is always.
Number of cards in hand would somtimes fail.
Number of cards in deck is correct.
Number of treasure cards would sometimes be incorrect.

For mine card function-
In randomtest1.c, out of 150 runs I would average around 231 total errors
for running the mine card effect, finding the hand count, and the treasure
count.

Assertion passed: Mine Card Effect
Assertion failed: handCount
Assertion failed: Treasures

Assertion passed: handCount

Assertion failed: Mine Card Effect
Assertion failed: handCount
Assertion passed: Treasures

None of the tests have all successfully passed at the same time, and each time
would resort in an assertion fail for different tests.
