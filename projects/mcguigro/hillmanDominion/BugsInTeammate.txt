One bug I found in my teammate’s code is that, when village is played, the player has the wrong number of actions.  The player consistently gains no actions, having 1 less than when the card is played.  This bug was uncovered by both my unit test for village, and by my random test for village.  However, my first hint that there was a problem with the code for village was a compiler warning, which pointed out a statement that did nothing and appeared to have a typo.  This statement was in fact the one responsible for managing the adding of 2 actions to the player.  Examining this line of code confirmed that this statement was in fact not giving the player any additional actions.
A second bug I found in my teammate’s code is that, when great hall is played, the number of actions the player has is incorrect.  This bug would have been detected by my unit test for great hall if that test hadn’t already reported a failure due to the great hall card not being put in the played cards pile (a bug that has been in the dominion code since the beginning).  I did not write a random tester for this card.  I found this bug, again, through a compiler warning that highlighted a dubious-looking statement.  Upon examining this statement (which was responsible for giving the player 2 actions), I found that it did nothing.
