Class: Serious Bug

Date: 03/05/2017 


Reported By: John Steiner
Email:steinerj@oregonstate.edu




Product: dominion.c             Version:

Platform: linux (flip server)   Version:

Browser: n/a                    Version:

URL: n/a
   


Is it reproducible: Yes



Description

===========

The card Smithy is supposed to cause the player to draw 3 cards. Currently
the function smithyCard() causes the player to draw 6 cards. At the end of a
turn the player has 5 additional cards (after discarding Smithy) instead of 2.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce

--------------------------

-Create external code linked to dominio.h and dominionhelpers.h
-Create two gameState instances.
-Initialize a game using the initializeGame() function.
-Copy the data from the initialized game into the other gameState
-Call the smithyCard() function.
-To confirm the bug compare the handCount of the current player in thegameState
that was unchanged and the handCount of the current player gameState where smithyCard() was called.





Expected Results

----------------

The current player's handCount should be increased by 2 (3 cards drawn and Smithy discarded)





Actual Results

--------------

Current player's handCount is increased by 5.






Workarounds

-----------
The game can be played but Smithy's behavior will not be consistent with its terms.





Attachments

None.
