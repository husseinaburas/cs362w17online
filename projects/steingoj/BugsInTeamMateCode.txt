Bugs In TeamMate Code
	Smithy/discardCard:
		For the Smithy card I was getting an error about the discardCount not being incremented properly. I double-checked my test to make sure it was checking correctly, then I looked at the smithyCard method. The only code which could alter the discardCount was the discardCard method because the rest of it was drawCard and that has nothing to do with the discardCount or, at least, if it does, I would have larger problems. From there I looked through the discardCard method and found there was no place where the discardCount was incremented.
	isGameOver:
		For isGameOver I was getting a message saying “Province being negative and no win”. From there it was obvious where the error came from since I knew there was a line of code that checked the count of province in isGameOver. 
	discardCard:
		I got an error message from my tests saying “handCount decreased with invalid low index” and it is because, when the handCount is set to 0. When I looked at the code it was working because the handCount was at a negative number and the check for if there was a positive handCount was also negative since it checks handCount – 1 and handCount was currently 0. It’s a weird bug for a weird situation and I don’t know if it would happen in an actual game.
