Bugs in TeamMate code:

I found multiple bugs in my teammates code. 

Smithy: In the smithy function, the first for loop is supposed to iterate from 0 to 3. Instead, the carrot is switched around so that the function iterates from 0 until while I is greater than 3 which doesn’t 
make sense as smithy is supposed to allow you to draw 3 cards. I found this bug through the smithy unit test as the player 1 hand count and deck count both failed their tests.
 
Remodel: In the playRemodel() function, I found a bug in the statement where we store the card that we will trash. That statement is affected by choice2 instead of choice1. 
I also noticed that the discard trashed card loop decrements I instead of incrementing, which means we won’t be able to properly discard trashed cards. I found this bug just by looking through this function.

Council Room: In the playCouncil_room function, I found a bug through the council room unit test. 
Both the tests that tested if council_room increases buys by 1 and increases handCount of owner by 3 failed. This led to the discovery of the bug in the for loop in that function. 
It increments from 0 to 7 instead of from 0 to 4, which means that the player will receive 7 cards. This explains the test for increasing handCount failing but what about the test for increasing buys? 
This led me to the discovery that the number of buys is decremented instead of incremented so the player would lose buys upon drawing this card.

Village: I found the bug for playVillage() rather easily in a coincidental fashion. The function is conveniently right above playCouncil_room, 
so while scrolling through I noticed a comment that said +5 actions. That didn’t make sense since I know for a fact that the village card increases actions by 2 and allows you to draw one card. 
Therefore, playVillage() should only add two to numActions instead of 5.
