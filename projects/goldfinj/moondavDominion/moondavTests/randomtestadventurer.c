Description:
    This is a random tester for the adventurer card in dominion.c. The variables
    that are selected randomly are:
    - numPlayers: The number of players in the game during testing.
    - currentPlayer: Which player's turn it is.
    - deckCount: The number of cards in a player's deck (each player has a
                 different random number of cards in their deck).
    - card: A card from the possible cards in the dominion game.
    - numTreasures: The number of treasure cards placed in the
                    player's deck.
    
    The following are key points the test will check:
    - The current player's played card count increases by 1
    - The player's deck decreases by the appropriate number of cards.
      i.e. The player draws until 2 treasures are revealed or the deck
      is depleted.
      Note: Currently, the test is setup with the player's played pile
      at 0, so there will not be a shuffle after depleting the deck.
    - The player's discard count increases by the appropriate amount
      of cards.
    - The player's hand count increases by the appropriate amount of
      cards, either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the number of treasures
      in the player's deck.

Note: Some skeleton code for game setup was taken from cardtest4.c,
    which was posted to the OSU CS-362 course web page.

Note: There was a bug in my original refactor of playAdventurer() where
    I didn't properly handle the event where the player draws through
    all of their deck and discards without finding 2 treasures. This
    caused a seg fault when the event occurred. I found it becuase of this
    test, but I needed to fix it in dominion.c so the test could run to 
    completion.
