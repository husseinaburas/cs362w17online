Bugs in Teammate Code:


Consistent failures in both Adventurer test programs highlighted a particular 
bug in which the Adventurer card was not removed from the player's hand, 
discarded, and marked as a played card.  In cardtest1.c, three tests failed 
every time:

1.	Number of cards in discard pile is correct
2.	Played count increased by 1
3.	Last played card was Adventurer

Similarly, in randomtestadventurer.c, three tests failed 10000 times out of 
10000:

1.	Number of cards in hand is correct
2.	Played count increased by 1
3.	Last played card was Adventurer

All of these failed tests indicated a failure to clean up after the card's 
action had been applied.


In the case of the Smithy card, a major bug was evident but not so easy to 
pinpoint directly from the tests.  Consider that in cardtest2.c, the following
three tests failed sometimes and passed others:

1.	Number of cards in discard pile is correct
2.	Number of cards in hand is correct
3.	Number of cards in deck is correct

Particularly bizarre evidence for the bug can be found in the skewed number of
successes and failures of the following tests from randomtestcard1.c:

1.	Number of cards in hand is correct (2 successes out of 10000 runs)
2.	Number of cards in deck is correct (4 successes out of 10000 runs)
3.	Number of cards in discard pile is correct (9786 successes out of 10000 runs)

It appeared that there was either an issue with drawing cards from the deck or
discarding the Smithy card.  Inspecting the output of the random tests, it 
appeared that the number of cards in the player's hand was almost always two 
fewer than it should have been.  This suggested exploring the loop inside 
playSmithy().
