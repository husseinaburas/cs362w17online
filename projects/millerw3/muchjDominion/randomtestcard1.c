//  Tests effect of village card (draw 1 cards, discard village, reduce player deck by 1, add 2 actions)
//
//      Random Tests:
//          player hand is increased by 0 (net total)
//          player deck is is reduced by 1
//          village card is discarded
//          player action count increased by 2
