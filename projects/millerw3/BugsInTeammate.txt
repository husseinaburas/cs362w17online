Assignment 5


Bugs were found at the following locations Adam Much's dominion.c file:

668 (adventurer card)
655 (smithy card)

The first bug added one too many treasures to the player's hand when the adventurer card was played.
The second bug did not initialize the index for the loop which draws cards for the smithy card,
resulting in erratic behavior.
