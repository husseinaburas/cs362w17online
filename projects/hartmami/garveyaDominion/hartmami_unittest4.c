**  verify there is an avaiable card supply of the target card
**  verify player has enough coins to buy the card
**  verify card is added to top of discard pile
**  verify other cards arent changed
**  verify numBuys, coins are correct
**  if using the DEBUG the last printf statment is missing the last %d and closing parenthesis.
**  try to buy a card without enough coins
