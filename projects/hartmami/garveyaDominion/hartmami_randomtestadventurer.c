**
**  Description:    randomtester for the card adventurer in dominion tests:
**
**  tester generates Pseudo random hand, and deck cards for 2 to 4 players then
**  	conducts all tests with full output uses getCard() helper function to
**  	properly display all hand and deck card names
**
**  when running over 10000 iterations with Pseudo random kingdom cards I would
**  	consistently have a stack overflow, I could not isolate exactly why this
**  	was occuring when using different kingdom cards.  I suspect it is a
**  	combination of cards in a specific order that causes the crash.  Because I
**  	could not isolate the source, I used a set of specific kingdom cards
**  	that I know will not cause a stack overflow.
**
**  verify preconditions
**  verify adventurer is at the top of curPlayer's discard pile
**  verify curPlayer's playedCardCount has been incremented to 1
**  verify curPlayer has expected number of cards in their hand
**  verify curPlayer has expected number of cards in their deck
**  verify the fifth card in curPlayer's hand
**  verify the sixth card in curPlayer's hand
**  verify all players are as expected
**
**  run 999 more iterations of the tests with limited output that can be
**  	checked agianst the first full run to determine the specific test
**  	which failed
**
**  seed, and number of players is logged for each iteration
**
**  finally a total count of all failed tests is output to randomtestadventurer.out
