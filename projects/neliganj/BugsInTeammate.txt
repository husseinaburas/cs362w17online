A bug was discovered in playSmithy(). This was exposed by cardtest1. In every tested case, the test reported 1 more card in the player’s hand than expected. Upon inspecting the code, it was clear that the for loop in which the player draws additional cards was running 1 extra iteration due to a <= sign in the loop condition, which should be a < sign (line 1133 in dominion.c).

The cardtest2 also exposed multiple bugs in the playAdventurer() function.  The test were primarily failing because the number of treasure cards in the player’s deck after playing Adventurer were much different than the expected values. First, the player draws cards from their deck until they draw 3 treasure cards instead of 2.  This is caused by a <= sign that should be a < sign in a for loop control statement. Secondly, at the end of the turn, the player discards one more card than they should. This is also the result of a for loop control where a <= sign should actually be a < sign (lines 1149 and 1169 in dominion.c).
