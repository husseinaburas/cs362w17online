BUGS:

Action Count:  The action count for the current player is consistently
1 less than the expected across all tests.  This would point to an 
error somewhere in the function playCard as it is the commonality among
all of the tests.

Hand Count and Cards:  The number of cards in hand for the current player
is consistently 1 more than expected.  This occurs across all tests.
This would point to an error somewhere in the function playCard or the following
logic as this is the commonality among all the tests.

Deck Count: The number of cards in the draw deck is consistently 1 less
than expected.  This backs up the previous bug that there is always 1 more
card in hand.  This shows that drawCard is being called one too many times
somewhere in the code.

Played Count:  The number of cards in played pile is always zero when it is
expected to be greater than 1.  All tests begin with a card being played.  That
card should be in the played pile at the time of testing.  This would point to 
an error in calling the discard function.  Most likely there is improper usage
of the trash flag.  Less than 1 goes to played pile where a 1 will go straight
to the discard pile.
