Bugs in Teammate’s Code

  The most glaring bug of James’ code was line 1321 of dominion.c, which is a
part of the playFeast() function. There is a while loop controlled by the x
variable being equal to 1, and this line was commented out, which prevented x
from changing and let the while loop continue infinitely. This appears to
occur any time the playFeast() function would be called, since the loop appears
to be intended to manage the process of acquiring the desired card. Outside of
that bug, there is also a bug in that there is no way of correctly handling the
player selecting a card that is more expensive than 5 coins. If this occurs,
there would always be an infinite loop (regardless of the bug at line 1321).
This was apparent due to the unit test never completing, which is why an
alteration to the source code was made to further test for additional bugs.

  Another bug is in playCouncil_Room(), which has the current player acquire a
lot more cards than they should. Line 1355-1358 is where this appears to
exists. Rather than draw cards for the other players, it will end up drawing
an additional card for the current player. This was clear since it had failed
the unit test for checking the hand count increased by 4, the deck had
decreased by 4, and that all other players had their hands increase by 1 and
decks decrease by 1. That had led me to look at the section of the function
responsible for triggering the other players to draw cards, and I could see
that the conditional was not correctly targeting the other players, but
rather, allowing the current player to draw an additional card.
