/**
 * Title:	Unit test for playSmithy() function
 * Author: Richard Moot
 * Description:	Tests proper functionality of playSmithy card function. Runs
 *  through several scenarios to ensure playSmithy correctly draws 3 new cards
 *  into a player's hand (and the other rules of the game are followed)
