1) Smithy Card
	Instead of giving the current player three cards, it gives
	the cards to other players in the game instead. This fault
	is within the for loop, line 685 in the dominion.c file.
	This was found both with unit tests and random tests for
	the smithy function.
2) Adventurer Card
	The bug introduced is that it shuffles the deck only once
	and only if the deck is empty before we've drawn any cards
	to check if they're treasures. This flaw is the logic
	statement from lines 652-654 in dominion.c file. This was
	found both with unit tests and random tests for the
	adventurer function.
