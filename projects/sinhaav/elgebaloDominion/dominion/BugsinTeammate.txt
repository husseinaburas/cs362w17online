	The first bug I found was in the playVillage function, here the number of actions given was increased from 2 to 4, which changes the rules of the game. Originally my card test was failing because of it, changing my test to allow for 4 actions rather than 2 helped it run with my partners code and thus pass the tests. The next bug I found was in Smithy which changed the loop from adding 3 cards to adding 5 cards. I noticed this when running my card test on smithy and found that the first 2 iterations of the test failed. This test would then run successfully after finding the bug. Another bug I found was in remodel, when browsing through my partner's version of dominion code, I was able to find that the loop for discard trash card would decrease when used rather than increase which was different than the remodel in the original dominion code that I had opened up for comparison.
