For my testme.c file, I decided to make the inputChar() function print random values
between 32 and 126 because that includes the alphabet and all the symbols required to
staisfy the state transitions. For the inputStr() function, I thought it would be best
to allocate all the space for the string, make an array with all the alphabet in it,
and then tack on a null character at the end. I forgot to put the null character on at
first and I waited for 11 million iterations before I realized it wasn't going to
produce an error. After I fixed that however, the program exited just fine.
