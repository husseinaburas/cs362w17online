playSmithy() and potentially drawCard()


Bug Description:
----------------

In my random test for the smithy card, playrandomtestcard1(), I received errors with a player's handcount not increasing by 3. I only got this error when I ran the random tests for a high number of iterations. For instance, with 200,000 random test cases, this error only emerged 7 times. So, I thought this might be an interesting bug to explore. Here's a test case from randomtestcard adventurer that produced the error (I have removed all the irrelevant output pertaining to other cases): 

		------Test#37562 Smithy Card--------
		Before playing smithy: player = 3; deck count = 0; discard count = 3; hand count = 485
		Playing now....
		...
		TEST#2 - changes in handCount
		ERROR#2 - player's hand size did not increase by 3
		 prior: 485 post: 487
		...

In the other 6 test cases producing the same error, the handcount did not increment properly. In some cases, it incremented by 2, incremented by 1, or did not increment at all. 

Potential Fix:
--------------

To me, given that playSmithy() is relatively straight-forward, the difference in the actual incrementation values, and that hand count is concerned would lead me to believe that the issue is with drawCard() and would require unit and random testing for that function.

playAdventurer() and potentially discardCard()

Bug Description:
----------------

In my random test for the adventurer card, playrandomtestadventurer, I received errors (most of the test cases) with playAdventurer failing to add the adventurer card to the played card pile. Here is test case from the output of randomtestadventurer (I have removed all the irrelevant output pertaining to other test cases):


		------Test#18881 Adventurer Card--------
		Before playing adventurer: player = 2; deck count = 167; discard count = 102; hand count = 155
		Playing now....
		....
		TEST#3 - adventurer card added to playedCard pile
		ERROR#3 - adventurer card not added to the played card pile
		....


Potential Fix
--------------

Because the card is not being added to the discard pile, it means that adventurer is remaining in the hand of the player.
This is interesting because you could continualy play adventurer. My theory for why this occurs is that in the code for playAdventurer, there is no code that explicitly discards the played adventurer card only the temporary cards.

			while(z-1>=0){
			  state->discard[currentPlayer][state->discardCount[currentPlayer]++]=temphand[z-1]; // discard all cards in play that have been drawn
			  z=z-1;
			      }

To remedy this, there would have to be a function call to discardCard() or some other mechanism for removing that card from the hand into the discard pile.
