 *    If the player has no Actions left, an error message should be returned.
 *    If successful:

 *      The current player's deck should have decreased by 4.
 *      The current player's numBuys should be incremented by 1.
 *      Every other player should have 1 additional card in their hand.
 *      Every other player's deck should be decremented by 1.
 *        Every other player's drawn card should come from their own deck.
 *      No supply pile should be changed.
