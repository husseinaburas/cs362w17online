 /* Feast testing check:

 *  playing this card:
 *    If the player has no Actions left, an error message should be returned.
 *    If player requests a card of no more than 5 cost:
 *      The player should have the chosen card added to their discard pile.
 *      The player's discardCount should be incremented by 1.
 *      The Feast card played should be trashed.
 *      The chosen card's supply count should be decremented by 1.
 *      No other supply pile should be changed.
 *    If player requests a card that is more than 5 cost:
 *      An error message should be returned.
 *    If the supply for the requested card is zero:
 *      An error message should be returned.
