To this statement:
	if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver|| cardDrawn == gold)

Bug 204: playCouncil room gives the player that played the card wrong number of cards.

Description:

Bug Fix:
Line 723 the if statement is missing a ! in front of the = character.

Change this if statement:

        if ( i = currentPlayer )

To this if statement:
        if ( i != currentPlayer )

-	This fixes the player that plays the council room function to only receive +4 cards instead of           receiving +5 cards.
