        GREAT HALL Card Test.

The purpose of this test is to pick two gameState variables to randomize during testing.
While randomizing these variables, I want to ensure that the Great Hall card will behave as
expected when running these exams.
 
The Two Variables I decided to randomize are:
    1> numberOfPlayers:  This will randomize the gameState variable numOfPlayers to ensure when the card is played, regardless of the number of players, the Actions will increment appropriately.
 
    2>  discardCount:  I randomized this gameState variable to ensure that when randomized, the number of cards in a players hand will be as expected ( i.e. one played, one gained ).
 
 The end result of this random test would be to ensure that randomizing these two variables 
 will result in the number of actions being apporpriate as well as Hand Count.
