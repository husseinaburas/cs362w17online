Bug 1:  Village Card
===============================================================
The mechanics behind the village card are as follows:
	You Get an additional Card
	You Get two more actions.

In my test, we tested for both conditions.  On my teammates code, one of the conditions were met, namely action count was properly increased. 
	PreAction Count: 1
	PostAction Count:3
	<Properly incremented by two, test passed>

However, the test failed on the hand count.  My test expected a hand Count of 5 but was delivered a hand count of 6, off by one.  




Bug 2:  Adventurer Card
===============================================================
The mechanics behind the Adventurer Card are as follows:
You reveal cards from your hand until you see two treasure cards, which you put in your hand.  You then discard the remaining cards.

In my test, I tested for an expected difference of  two in both the handcount and the deck count.

On both tests, the expected difference was not met.  

On the handCount, the results were as follows:
      HandCount before Play: 5
      HandCount    after Play: 6  
      <the difference here was 1 rather than 2, failing my test>

On the deckCount, the results were as Follows:
	DeckCount before Play: 5
	DeckCount    after Play:  4
	< the difference here was also 1, rather than 2, failing my test>








Bug 3:  Smithy 
===============================================================
When running my cardTest on the smithy card, I discovered a bug in my teammates code.

The mechanics behind the smithy card are as follows: 
You play the smithy card and you are allowed to draw 3 additional cards.  

On my teammates code, when executing this test, his code allowed for only two additional cards to be drawn, making his card count increase by only two cards.
	Current HandCount: 7
	Actual HandCount: 9
	<Test failure, expected a difference of 3 >


Additionally, we expected the player?s deckCount to be shifted by three as well, which was tested and failed:
	Pre  DeckCount: 0
	Post DeckCount:  2
	<Expected difference of 3, test failure>

My teammates smithy card did pass on a third condition tested, which was a state variable of the other player.  I tested to see if another players deckCount would be disturbed and it was not:
	deckCount Other Player Pre:  10
	deckCount Other Player Post: 10
