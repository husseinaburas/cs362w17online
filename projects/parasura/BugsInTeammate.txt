Bugs in Teammate’s Code
In William Miller’s code, bugs were found in the Adventurer and Smithy cards.

The smithy card seems to discard one less cards than it should, causing an overflow later on. This is probably a simple fix with an iterator.

The adventurer card appears to incorrectly trash the wrong player’s cards, affecting the player casting the card instead.
