Place at least two treasure cards in the current player's deck.
	Note: The two treasure cards must not be placed in the top two indices of the current
	player's deck. i.e. The player must be able to draw at least 1 non-treasure card.
Observe the discard array for the current player.
Observe the discard count for the current player.
Play the Adventurer card.
Observe the discard array for the current player.

cards.
