Description:
    This is a random tester for the smithy card in dominion.c. The variables
    that are selected randomly are:
    - numPlayers: The number of players in the game during testing.
    - currentPlayer: Which player's turn it is.
    - deckCount: The number of cards in a player's deck (each player has a
                 different random number of cards in their deck).
    - card: A card from the possible cards in the dominion game.
    
    The following are key points the test will check:
    - The current player's actions decrease by 1
    - The current player's hand count increases by 2 (+3 for the card,
      and -1 to play the test card)
    - The current player's deck count decreases by 3
    - The current player's palyed card count increases by 1

Note: Some skeleton code for game setup was taken from cardtest4.c,
    which was posted to the OSU CS-362 course web page.
