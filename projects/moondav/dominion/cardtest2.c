Description:
    This test will test the adventurer card in dominion.c.
    The following are key points the test will check:
    - The current player's played card count increases by 1
    - The player's deck decreases by the appropriate amount of cards
    - The player's discard count increases by the appropriate amount
      of cards
    - The player's hand count increases by the appropriate amount of
      cards, (2 if the player's deck contains at least 2 treasure cards)


Note: Some skeleton code for game setup was taken from cardtest4.c,
    which was posted to the OSU CS-362 course web page.

Include the following lines in your makefile:

cardtest2: cardtest2.c dominion.o rngs.o
    gcc -o cardtest2 -g cardtest2.c dominion.o rngs.o $(CFLAGS)
